## 🌟 About Me

I'm a detail-oriented software developer passionate about building scalable web apps, crafting seamless user experiences, and leading product-driven development. With over 3 years of experience, I've contributed to projects in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Django**, and **Next.js**, ranging from distributed social platforms to neuro-integrated dating apps.

I thrive in **agile teams**, love debugging 🐛, and enjoy mentoring and community involvement (also a taekwondo instructor 🥋!).
